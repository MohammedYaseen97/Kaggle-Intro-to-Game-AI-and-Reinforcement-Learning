Following are my notebooks created during the Kaggle Learn Course [Intro to Game AI and Reinforcement Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-game-ai-and-reinforcement-learning)

## Purpose
This small project was done purely for practice and just to get a feel of attempting reinforcement learning based problems on kaggle. I submitted solutions to the problem [ConnectX](https://www.kaggle.com/c/connectx)
